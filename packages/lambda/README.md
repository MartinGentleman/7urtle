## Why lambda

Lambda was created to allows us to perform powerful functional programming in JavaScript. It focuses on providing highly
performant code which is itself built using functional paradigms. Provided functions are simple, curried, pure
and optimised for partial application and function composition.

Lambda functions are never bloated by performing extra tasks. Because of that the code is very lightweight
and predictable.
